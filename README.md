# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

1. Identify an Imaging Technique
- The imaging technique inspiration comes from this [Vincent Van Gough’s Starry night reimagined as an interactive app for iPad and android](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph1SEFWcL58) that turns the artwork into strokes.

2. Project Discussing
- The imaging technique above creates/recreates an artwork into many strokes and animates the strokes to move in certain directions of the art piece. The imaging technique can be used on the assignment for Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' or Claude Monet's 'Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule as both of the art pieces are mainly constructed by distinct lines. 

- The above example can be used for the individual task in our assignment where we need to develop an animated image as well. **Audio, Time-Based, and User Input** could be implemented to control the speed of the stroke movements.

3. Screenshots or Images
